# Over-Voltage-Under-Voltage-Protection-System
I have designed an Over Voltage Under Voltage Protection System using ESP32. So basically what it does is it detects the voltage using Voltage Sensor ZMPT101B and check whether the voltage is over or under. Based on that it trips off the device and it does display on the 16x2 display screen.
