# Over Voltage Under Voltage Protection System using ESP32

This project implements an Over Voltage Under Voltage Protection System using an ESP32, a ZMPT101B voltage sensor, and a 16x2 LCD display. The system continuously monitors the AC supply voltage, detects over-voltage and under-voltage conditions, and trips (disconnects) the device in unsafe conditions. The voltage and system status are displayed in real-time on the LCD.

## ‚≠ê Features

- **Real-Time Voltage Monitoring:** Continuously reads AC voltage using the ZMPT101B sensor.
- **Automatic Protection:** Trips (turns off) the relay when voltage is unsafe (over or under thresholds).
- **User Feedback:** Displays measured voltage and status (Normal, Over Voltage, Under Voltage, No AC) on a 16x2 LCD.
- **Serial Output:** Prints voltage readings and status to the Serial Monitor for debugging or logging.
- **Simple Circuit:** Built with easily available components and minimal wiring.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the ZMPT101B sensor, LCD, and relay to your ESP32 as per the pin definitions in the code.
2. **Install Required Libraries:**  
   - `ZMPT101B` (install via Library Manager or download from GitHub)
   - `LiquidCrystal` (install via Library Manager)

3. **Upload the Code:**  
   Use the Arduino IDE to upload [`main.ino`](OV_UV_Protection_System) to your ESP32.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### 1. LCD Not Displaying Text

- **Check Wiring:** Ensure all LCD pins are correctly connected to the ESP32 as per the code.
- **Contrast:** Adjust the potentiometer (if used) for contrast.
- **Initialization:** Confirm `lcd.begin(16, 2);` is in `setup()`.
- **Blog:** Here is a blog which helped me solving this issue. See[`blog`](https://diyprojectslabs.com/interfacing-zmpt101b-voltage-sensor-with-esp32/)

### 2. No Voltage Reading / Always 0V

- **Sensor Wiring:** Make sure the ZMPT101B sensor's output is connected to the correct analog pin (27 by default).
- **Sensitivity:** Try adjusting the `SENSITIVITY` value in code for your sensor.
- **Calibration:** Double-check the `CALIBRATION_FACTOR` or adjust based on your AC supply. In India the Frequency for AC Input is 50 Hz and I have set the Callibration according to 220V AC.

### 3. Relay Not Switching

- **Pin Definition:** Ensure `RELAY_PIN` in code matches your actual relay pin.
- **Relay Wiring:** Confirm relay VCC and GND connections; some relay modules require external power.
- **Relay Type:** If using a 5V relay, ensure it is compatible with ESP32's output logic level.

### 4. Serial Monitor Shows Garbage Values

- **Baud Rate:** Set Serial Monitor to 115200 baud.
- **Wiring:** Avoid cross-talk between LCD and Serial pins.

### 5. Device Does Not Trip on Over/Under Voltage

- **Thresholds:** Verify `OVER_VOLTAGE` and `UNDER_VOLTAGE` constants in code match your requirements.
- **Sensor Output:** Use Serial Monitor to confirm voltage readings are accurate.

### 6. Interfacing ZMPT101B Voltage Sensor with ESP32
- **Blog:** Here is a blog which helped me solve how to interface ZMPT101B sensor with ESP32. After this i got the perfect reading.See[`blog`](https://diyprojectslabs.com/interfacing-zmpt101b-voltage-sensor-with-esp32/)

There will be a garbage voltage reading when the power is off, it is due to the Induced/Ghost Voltage.
